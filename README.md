# AdaBins Monocular Depth Estimation 🔍📏

This repository contains a minimal setup to run **AdaBins** for monocular depth estimation on images. 
This repository was created to provide **easy access to AdaBins** for monocular depth estimation on images (video support coming soon). The original AdaBins implementation is powerful but can be difficult to set up for quick experimentation or integration.

## 🚀 Features

- Monocular depth estimation using AdaBins.
- Visualizes depth map with `plasma` colormap.
- Scalable, modular code structure.
- Easy setup for research or project use.

## Why This Repo? 🤔

- ✅ Simplified setup — minimal code, clean structure
- ✅ Clear documentation — get started fast
- ✅ Image-based depth estimation ready to use
- 💻 Ideal for demos, research, or integration into larger projects

## 🛠️ Installation

This repo simplifies the use of **AdaBins** for monocular depth estimation. To get started, follow these steps:

---

### 1. Clone the Original AdaBins Repository (for model files)

Download the official AdaBins repository to access pre-trained models and reference code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shariqfarooq123/AdaBins.git
```

2. Clone This Repository (Simplified Setup)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adabins-depth-estimation.git
cd adabins-depth-estimation
```
3. Install Required Dependencies
Create and activate a virtual environment with python 3.8 - 3.10 for clean installation.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
